# Spherical Wavelet Format

About this Repo:

This is a working repository for ongoing research on Spherical Wavelet Format (SWF), a spatial audio format developed by Davide Scaini and Daniel Arteaga at Dolby Laboratories in Barcelona. In trimesh.py, you will find an implementation of a triangular mesh that supports the Encoding and Decoding filters P,Q,A,B as described in :

> D. Scaini and D. Arteaga, “Wavelet-Based Spatial Audio Format” J. Audio Eng. Soc., vol. 68, no. 9, pp. 613–627, (2020 September.). DOI: https://doi.org/10.17743/jaes.2020.0049

And supports updating the trivial interpolating filter via the Lifting Scheme or the Modified Lifting Scheme.

The notebooks deal with various vizualization strategies to see the mesh as well as the visualization of portions of the filters on the mesh.
